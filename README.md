# 3D Developer Portfolio

A personal 3D portfolio built with React and Three.js to showcase my projects and skills.

## Tech Stack

- **React**
- **Three.js** (React Three Fiber & Drei)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion**
- **Vite**

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Build for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

This will generate a `dist` folder ready for deployment.
